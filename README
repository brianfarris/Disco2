-You will need to compile hdf5 with parallel support. Using macports won't give you this. I did it by simply compiling the source using mpicc. make sure you edit the Makefile according to the location of your installation.
-Viscosity is turned off when you set it to a negative number
-let N_p vary by setting NP_CONST to negative number
-turn of damping by setting DAMP_TIME to negative number
-set RLogScale and ZLogScale to large numbers to get uniform grid spacing.
-running with no inner boundary condition is currently tricky. You want to set the flag NoInnerBC=1 in your .par file, but you still need to set R_Min to be greater than 0 and big enough so that the inner face of the 1 inner ghostzone does not accidentally become negative. We will definitely figure out something better than this soon.
-Right now you need to run on a number of procs that allows you to divide the grid evenly in both r and z. This is kind of bad because when we keep the aspect ratio constant the outer procs are going to have more phi zones and our load balancing will be bad. Also, we could reduce inter-processor surface area and thus the number of ghost zones if we took NumR and NumZ into account when we figure out how to distrubute the procs. These things will be improved soon.
