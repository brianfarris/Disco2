desired features
****************
Have Dan update the viscosity so that it can accomodate an alpha law.
Put real diagnostics in. Now we simply compute average density and pressure. We can add more as we go, but at some point we should find a more elegant solution so that we are not constantly changing the source code.
make it so that GravMasses don't need to be on constant orbits
make it so that we can restart from checkpoint without a par file if we want to.
make it so that we can run on any number of procs
work on load balancing
see if it is possible to avoid using buffers in syncing and IO
openMP support
create awesome documentation using doxygen

***************
quality control
***************
add other code tests
test for 2nd order convergence
check that checkpoint restart agrees to machine precision
thoroughly test boundary damping
