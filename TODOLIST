Put real diagnostics in
make it so that GravMasses don't need to be on constant orbits
make it so that we can restart from checkpoint without a par file
make it so that we can run on any number of procs
see if it is possible to avoid using buffers in syncing and IO
openMP support
create awesome documentation using doxygen

***************
quality control
***************
test boundary damping
check that checkpoint restart agrees to machine precision
test for 2nd order convergence
add other code tests
